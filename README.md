# NutriFitCLI (Nutirition Fitness CLI)

## Description
### About this application:
This is a meal and exercise tracking application that allows users to add/remove meal logs, add/remove exercise logs, view logs by date, view calories burned by day/month, preview a monthly visual calendar for logged activities.
- Developed in Python and runs from the Command Line Interface (CLI) (includig Linux/Ubuntu).
- Utilizes python modules & consists of multiple source files.
- Covers advanced features covered in ENGR 5200G including arrays, for loop, while loop, switch statements, modules, classes, constructors, functions, objects, and more!

### Why it was developed:
 The idea seems complex enough to incorporate a lot of elements we explored in class, and would make for a great addition to my portfolio. Additionally, this is an idea/application I have not explored before, and could be a project that could potentially build out further into fully functional web or mobile application.

## Delete Later:
The readme file (Markdown or PDF) should be at least one page (and not more than 2 pages) and contains
the following items: title of the application, brief description of what it is and why it was
developed, an architecture diagram of the application, how to compile and/or run it from
the command line, challenges and future enhancements.
