# NutriFitCLI (Nutirition Fitness CLI)
### A *meal and exercise tracker* that displays information on food and calories consumed and includes a list of activates done on any given day if information has been logged.

## Delete Later:
The readme file (Markdown or PDF) should be at least one page (and not more than 2 pages) and contains
the following items: title of the application, brief description of what it is and why it was
developed, an architecture diagram of the application, how to compile and/or run it from
the command line, challenges and future enhancements.


### Architectural Diagram:

Runs from the command-line on Linux/Ubuntu. Must not be a web app, and it does not
need to have a graphical user interface, but it can be a game that runs from command
line.
• Must use C++ or Python. You may use any C++ library, Python module or package.
• Must consist of multiple source files with some advanced features covered in the course
(e.g., header files, file i/o, object-oriented programming, functions & methods, etc.). No,
it does not have to be an object-oriented application, but it cannot be a single source file.

Details:
What: The project idea is to make a meal and exercise tracker that displays information on food and calories consumed and includes a list of activates done on any given day if information has been logged. Why: The idea seems complex enough to incorporate a lot of elements we explored in class, and would make for a great addition to my portfolio. Additionally, this is an idea/application I have not explored before, so I am eager to learn something new. How: I intend to provide a list of options for the user to choose from in the CLI. Depending on what the user selects, they can either log or view information. Each tracker will be handled in a separate file. I plan to store the collected information in either JSON or CSV format depending on whichever seems suitable. Ideally, I would like to use a calendar module or library to manage the days. If time permits, I would also like to try and find a simple API that I can implement for basic calorie information. If not, I will generate a list of food items and their nutrition info to simulate an API call. My goal is to apply as much of the knowledge I have gained in class for this project in order to deepen my understanding of the fundamentals.
